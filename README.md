# Quantum computing random number generator

Here's my first toe in the water with quantum computing using the projectq python library.

I found [this tutorial](http://dataespresso.com/en/2018/07/22/Tutorial-Generating-random-numbers-with-a-quantum-computer-Python/index.html) on how to use the library for some basics.


1. install projectq
```
pip install projectq
```
